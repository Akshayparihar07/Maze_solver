## Introduction

This project consists of a Python script that generates a random maze and attempts to find a path from the start to the end point using a simple recursive backtracking algorithm.

## Features

- Maze generation with random placement of walls.
- Pathfinding using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Visual representation of the generated maze and solution path.

## Usage

### Options

1. **Generate a Maze and Start Finding a Path**
   - This option generates a maze, displays it, and attempts to find a path from the start to the end point.

2. **Exit the Program**
   - This option exits the program.

### Maze Generation

- Enter the maze size when prompted.
- The generated maze will be displayed, and the start ('S') and end ('E') points will be marked.

### Pathfinding

- If a path exists, the program will find and display the solution path.
- If no path exists, a message will be displayed.

## Project Structure

- `maze.py`: The main Python script containing maze generation and pathfinding functions.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.
- (Other files as needed)

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies. It uses standard Python libraries for randomization and time-related functions.
