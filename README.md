# Rat in a Maze Game

## Description

This project implements a simple "Rat in a Maze" game using a maze generator and a path-finding algorithm. The rat (represented by üê≠) needs to find a path to the destination (represented by üèÅ) while avoiding obstacles (represented by üß±).

## Files

1. **maze_generator.py**: Contains functions to generate a maze with random walls.

2. **path_finder.py**: Implements a path-finding algorithm using depth-first search (DFS) and backtracking.

3. **main.py**: The main script to interact with the user, generate a maze, and find a path.

## How to Run

1. **maze_generator.py**: Run this file to generate a maze with walls and a starting/ending point.

    ```bash
    python maze_generator.py
    ```

2. **path_finder.py**: Run this file to find a path in the generated maze.

    ```bash
    python path_finder.py
    ```

3. **main.py**: Run this file to interact with the game. It allows you to generate a maze, visualize it, and find a path.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Choose option 1 in `main.py` to generate a maze.
2. Wait for the path to be generated.
3. If a valid path is found, it will be displayed; otherwise, a message will indicate that no valid path was found.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
